# RomCom Paired Project

**Contributors**

**Project Description**

This was a paired project that was designed to create romance novel book covers. Upon window load or a click of a button, you could produce random covers using images, titles and tag lines.  You could also add, save and remove covers that you generated through a form.  This was a beginning development project for Turing's frontend program.

**Project Goals**

* Create a functioning website with the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
* Use variables, event listeners, event handlers, event delegation, classes and functions to allow navigation through the webpage.
* Attempt to have very clean JavaScript and CSS code and refactor whenever possible with a goal of readability.
* Become familiar with the use of GitHub and branching when working on a paired project.

**Challenges**

* Mastering the GitHub workflow with many branches and more than one team member.
* We had to add more code than desired in order to make sure that the app did not include bugs.
* Getting the form generated cover to display was the most challenging part of functionality in the project.

**Wins**

* Working with JS in a collaborative environment to a deadline.
* Teamwork that lead to professional development growth.
* All functionality is working through Iteration 5.

**Programming Languages Used**

HTML
CSS
JavaScript

**Other Important Features Implemented**
